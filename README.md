# Automated (mostly) photometry for Python 3

The primary use of this program is to generate light curves for active galactic nuclei reverberation mapping projects. The majority of the code makes use of available python packages such as Astropy.

For an example of what light curves can be used for see Montano et al. 2022 (ApJL) or the AGN Space Telescope Optical Reverberation Mapping 2 (STORM 2) project publications. 

I am an astronomy researcher so note that when looking at my code. If you have improvements, advice, and/or questions I am open to hearing them.
